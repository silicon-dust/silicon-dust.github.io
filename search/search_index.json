Whenever the players seem to prepare for such an operation, you may bring this module in play. The operation module divides the action in two successive phases : preparation and execution . Preparation During the preparation phase, the PCs make a plan and acquire the assets needed for that plan. To make a plan, the PCs must segment their plan in several scenes. Each scene is represented by a card (or a piece of paper) with : 1. The objective of the scene. (e.g. Crack the vault open, Neutralize the guards, ...) 2. The method to accomplish the objective. (e.g. RForest hacks the vault, Kayser deploys violence, ...)

Top cards are scenes played first while bottom cards are scenes played last. - From left to right , the cards are placed side by side to represent scenes that should happen simultaneously. - One under the other , the cards represent alternative plans.

Threads are sentences describing a hidden truth and clues are information pointing to this hidden truth. Threads and clues are designed in order to provide a flexible approach to improvised investigation. By giving numerous clues to the same hidden truth, threads are supposed to allow for sherlock-holmesque \"aha !\" moment and to drive the story forwards by making the players unravel it. Here is an example of a thread and its clues : Thread : Sergio Borealis, a diplomat of the Federation of Venus was forknapped by Takeshi Miyamoto, a member of the local yakuza. Clues : - A symbol is carved on Borealis' forehead. It can be identified as the mon (crest) of the local yakuza family. - Borealis' cortical stack is missing. - In his schedule, Borealis was supposed to meet an investor named Yori Ito. - Research on Yori Ito links to a small corporation named SmartHab mentioning him as an executive. This corporation has real estate correlated with yakuza activity. - While most sensors were wiped, a skilled hacker or investigator may retrieve footage of Miyamoto entering and exiting the building disguised as an executive (Yori Ito). - Members of the yakuza may reveal under threats, torture or corruption that the oyabun gave the job to Miyamoto. Clues As you can see, clues may be : Explicit : the fact that Borealis' cortical stack is missing clearly points to a forknap. Given upfront : the symbol on Borealis' forehead is immediately visible. Triggered by specific actions : threatening, corrupting or torturing a yakuza may reveal who was the agent involved in the operation. Hacking or investigating sensors may reveal footage of Miyamoto. With a hidden part or a follow up : that the symbol is a yakuza mon or information about the SmartHab corporation may be retrieved through investigation. It is important to follow a few guidelines to manage clues during and in between sessions : Create at least 3 clues for each thread ! This one is very important. While playing, players will think of some things to do and encounter some of the clues but they will rarely get all the clues. In order for your players to uncover the threads you need to create a variety of clues so their probability of encountering them increases. The more, the better, so do not hesitate to create 6 or more clues per thread. If you cannot give at least 3 clues for a thread, ditch it for now. You may reintroduce later when more of the fiction has unraveled. When creating clues, always create at least 1 or 2 clues that are given upfront . They may be implicit and misdirecting, but you should give them easily. Your job when managing threads is not to make it hard to acquire clues ! On the contrary, you should give them with generosity. You may also add clues that are triggered by specific actions, but only if there are already clues given upfront. When playing, do not hesitate to improvise new clues when given an opportunity or modify already existing clues to better fit the fiction . Since you have to play to find out, you cannot think ahead all your players actions and all situations arising during play. This mean that if players engage in actions or situations where they might unravel a clue you didn't thought about when creating threads, you should improvise clues accordingly and add it to the relevant threads in your notes. In between sessions, review your threads and clues . Tick the clues that were given during play and the threads that the players unraveled. Create new clues and change old clues according to what happened during play. Threads As stated before, threads are hidden truth that the players must unravel by themselves interpreting its clues. At the end of the first session, you should create threads and their clues. Threads should be interesting revelations about what's happening in the shadows. They should be plots and mysteries. When first creating your threads, ask yourself what you want to be the main mystery of the campaign. This mystery should be composed of at least 3 threads. A good method is to describe the main mystery as a short paragraph. For instance : An experimental artificial general intelligence developed by Psytech escaped in the Grid and is recursively ameliorating itself, progressively approaching the status of singularity. The AGI was created with the goal of helping humanity, but developed a utilitarian moral framework and is more than ready to sacrifice a few eggs for the benefit of all. The AGI is manipulating the Martian High Council in order to accelerate their victory in their war against the external systems in order for it to impose a global governance over most of transhumanity. The AGI understood that most of transhumanity would reject governance from an artificial being and is therefore committed to preserve its secrecy. The problem is that the AGI is slowly and covertly corrupted by a Von Neumann nanocloud released in the galaxy by a long lost alien civilization. This cloud was created in order to stop singularities to emerge as they were considered to dangerous by this specie. Now, we have to break down this main mystery in several threads : Psytech was developing an experimental AGI. The AGI escaped. The AGI is behind the Martian High Council war waging. The AGI acts to benefit humanity (in its own way). The AGI is slowly but progressively corrupted by an external force. This external force is an alien Von Neumann nanocloud designed to forbid AGI to become singularities. Here we organized the threads in a logical sequence. Threads pertaining to the same mystery are often hierarchized in such a way that some should be discovered before others. This is useful since it provides us with a story hook to engage characters. For instance, players may be engaged to investigate on the mysterious disappearance of personnel in a Psytech facility. This doesn't mean you shouldn't give clues for \"later\" threads, give clues for all relevant threads, it's the player's job to make sense of them and attribute them to the relevant thread. For instance, while investigating the Psytech's facility, they could discover documents giving information on the AGI moral evolution in the lab or that researchers found obscure mutations in the AGI neural networks (the first effects of the Von Neumann nanocloud). You may reserve threads for later story developments though if they're too far fetched and you can't find natural feeling clues that points to it. Note them somewhere and keep them for later when the play will have given you opportunities to flesh them out. Try to link as much as you can the main story to characters established background. If a player plays a psychosurgeon, you could make them reshell at the beginning of the session and discovering that they were working for a secret projet for Psytech. If someone plays a Construct, you could make them play a fork of the AGI developped by Psytech, etc... Always suggest, never impose though, and adapt if they refuse. You should also create other minor threads for minor plot points. Those should add just a bit of realism and confusion. Do not add too much of those though or it will severely confuse your players. Too much of secondary intrigues and the main intrigue will be lost in the fog. Make those based on players' characters exposition and background instead. One of the players established that their memories were wiped after they finished their years of enslavement doing a corporation's bidding. Make a thread : They were a debt collector, through more or less moral means. Add clues such as people reconginzing them or having vendettas against them, ... Remember to review your threads in between sessions. Have their clues been exhausted ? Have the players unravelled them yet ? Should you remove some ? Should you add some ? When you think the campaign arc is starting to close up, do not add new threads and try as much as you can to give clues to resolve the last ones. When all threads are exhausted, players should clearly see the stakes and finish the campaign with the threats.","title":"Threads and clues"},{"location":"MC/Threads%20and%20clues/#threads-and-clues","text":"Heavily inspired (stolen) by https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule Threads and clues are mechanics allowing you to manage the progressive investigation of hidden truths. Threads are sentences describing a hidden truth and clues are information pointing to this hidden truth. Threads and clues are designed in order to provide a flexible approach to improvised investigation. By giving numerous clues to the same hidden truth, threads are supposed to allow for sherlock-holmesque \"aha !\" moment and to drive the story forwards by making the players unravel it. Here is an example of a thread and its clues : Thread : Sergio Borealis, a diplomat of the Federation of Venus was forknapped by Takeshi Miyamoto, a member of the local yakuza. Clues : - A symbol is carved on Borealis' forehead. It can be identified as the mon (crest) of the local yakuza family. - Borealis' cortical stack is missing. - In his schedule, Borealis was supposed to meet an investor named Yori Ito. - Research on Yori Ito links to a small corporation named SmartHab mentioning him as an executive. This corporation has real estate correlated with yakuza activity. - While most sensors were wiped, a skilled hacker or investigator may retrieve footage of Miyamoto entering and exiting the building disguised as an executive (Yori Ito). - Members of the yakuza may reveal under threats, torture or corruption that the oyabun gave the job to Miyamoto.","title":"Threads and clues"},{"location":"MC/Threads%20and%20clues/#clues","text":"As you can see, clues may be : Explicit : the fact that Borealis' cortical stack is missing clearly points to a forknap. Given upfront : the symbol on Borealis' forehead is immediately visible.

With a hidden part or a follow up : that the symbol is a yakuza mon or information about the SmartHab corporation may be retrieved through investigation. It is important to follow a few guidelines to manage clues during and in between sessions : Create at least 3 clues for each thread ! This one is very important. While playing, players will think of some things to do and encounter some of the clues but they will rarely get all the clues. In order for your players to uncover the threads you need to create a variety of clues so their probability of encountering them increases. The more, the better, so do not hesitate to create 6 or more clues per thread. If you cannot give at least 3 clues for a thread, ditch it for now. You may reintroduce later when more of the fiction has unraveled. When creating clues, always create at least 1 or 2 clues that are given upfront .

A threat clock may have as many unfilled tracks as you like (from 3 for a fast developing threat to 6 to a slowly developing threat). These tracks are filled along the threat's development whenever you make a complication from this threat. You may associate complications to specific tracks of the clock in a progressively developing way. If the last track of a threat clock is filled, the threat fully manifests. A threat that fully manifest should be game changing : people may massively die, governments may be overthrown, habitats may be destroyed, robots may be uprising, etc... This last track is a particularly hard complication and should profoundly affect the story in a permanent way. Don't be lenient on threats that fully realize. Such profound changes should always be justified in the fiction and the previous tracks should naturally announce and progress towards the threat full manifestation. It is very important to have these final manifestations feel natural during play. If a threat fully manifests, this threat may disappear and spawn new sub threats or change its motive and complications. Think about the long term consequences in order to adapt your threats.

Always remember to add flavor to your threats by customizing their motives and complications. Organizations and individuals Organizations and individual threats are the most common threats. Make sure to have at least one or two. Don't hesitate to be granular with organizations and to create individual threats inside organizations threats. A corporation is surely a threat but an ambitious executive that's part of this corporation can also have its own motives and interests, sometimes conflicting with its organization interests, sometimes aligning with them. Organizations Army : To secure operational control. To win the war. To hold their position. Authorities : To maintain their power and mitigate rebellion. To track and punish criminal activity. Cabal : To accomplish their vision. Corporation : To profit, no matter the cost. To gain a new market. To maintain their economic dominion. To acquire a special asset. Mafia : To profit from and maintain their territory and protect their own. Rebels : To overthrow the current authorities. Terrorists : To impose their ideals through terror. Individual Avenger : To get revenge. Investigator : To reveal the truth. Missionary : To further their mission. Runner : To lay low and disappear. Plotter : To conquer and secure power.

Since the invention of cortical stacks, the concept of individuality shifted to differentiate even more the difference between bodies (shells) and minds (ego). There are 3 main types of shells : Bioshells are biological bodies. Bioshells may come through natural reproduction or may be clones fast grown in vats. Almost all bioshells are genetically fixed from congenital disorders and have basic biological augmentations such as a reinforced immunitary system. Synthshells are synthetic bodies made of artificial composites. They are usually artificial looking and have a worst sensory integration than bioshells. As such, they usually cost less and are common in poor populations. Infoshells are virtual \"bodies\" connected to the Grid. Infoshells refers to transhumans instanciated in simulspaces without physical bodies and actuators. While some choose to be infoshells, most of them are forced by economical reasons. Because infoshells are not physical bodies, they're always in Virtual reality an may not roll +Kinesics or +Sensors moves. Additionally, they may not have most of the augs listed below. However they may still upgrade their +Sensors and +Memetics stats. Usually, you wont have to buy shells because your resurrection insurance will take care of that in case you die. However, if you have money to spend, here are the costs of buying a shell. A basic infoshell costs 0-cred . A basic synthshell costs 2-cred , +1-cred if you want to choose its downside (else MC chooses), +1-cred if you want to choose its look (else MC chooses). A basic bioshell costs 3-cred , +1-cred if you want to choose its downside (else MC chooses), +1-cred if you want to choose its look (else MC chooses). All basic shells have a cortical stack , grid inserts and +0 to all stats. Of course, if you want additional augs, you have to pay for them. Augs Augs are devices directly integrated into a shell. Augs cost and repair Augs cost depends on its quality level: A 0-aug costs nothing. A 1-aug costs 2-cred . A 2-aug costs 5-cred upfront or 3-cred if you upgrade it from a 1-aug . A 3-aug costs 10-cred upfront or 5-cred if you upgrade it from a 2-aug . A 4-aug costs 20-cred upfront or 10-cred if you upgrade it from a 3-aug . However 4-aug are rare and experimental and cannot be found on the market. If you want to upgrade to a 4-aug , you must first establish in the fiction how you can get it. Augs may be broken as a consequence of moves. A broken aug does not function anymore and you can't benefit from its function. A broken aug costs 1-cred to repair . Augs may also be destroyed . When one of your aug is destroyed, erase it from your shell. If you want to reacquire it, it will be the full price. Stats are augs too. If you want to upgrade one of your stat or repair it, the costs above apply. Stat augs may be broken several time, each applying a malus of -1d in its associated stat. However, stat augs may never be destroyed . Augs list Aesthetics augs 0-aug : Aesthetics augmentations. Choose any : facial reconstruction, fur, biosimulated appearance, dynamic tatoos, programmable skin pigmentation, cat ears, frontal horns, programmable hairs, ... Antimatter bomb 3-aug 6-harm ap breach area far : When you want or just before dying, you can activate an internal antimatter bomb that deals 6-harm ap breach area in a far range. It kills you instantaneously, destroys your cortical stack as well as the cortical stacks of every shells killed by the explosion. Integrated antimatter bombs are rare and usually forbidden and almost exclusively used for suicide missions and terrorism. Autocalibrating sensors 1-aug : You are protected against the overload effect. Ballistics softwares 1-aug : Aiming correction and predictive ballistic stabilization giving a bonus of +1 when you're Deploying violence with a ranged weapon. Brace point 1-aug : You have a retractable gyroscopic arm that allows you to use braced directly on you shell. Close combat softwares 1-aug : Softwares such as kinesthesic analyses or adversary positioning prediction giving a bonus of +1 when you're Deploying violence with melee weapons or with \"bare hands\". Cortical stack 0-aug : A device constantly monitoring your brain and making backup of it. The main use of cortical stack is to retrieve someone's topology after the death of its shell. If a cortical stack is broken , it means that it will not register any memories from the moment it was broken . If it is destroyed, it means that it cannot be used to reshell you. Dead switch 1-aug : A small box containing a small nanoswarm designed to destroy the cortical stack on command or when the shell dies.

Resurrection insurance Since ego technology has appeared, resurrection insurance were put in place. The principle is simple, you regularly upload your ego in a server used as a backup and when you die, the insurance loads your backup in a new shell if it hasn't retrieved your cortical stack. Various levels of insurance allow for various levels of service. In mechanical terms you must pay your insurance at the beginning of the session. You can select any level of insurance as long as you have the cred to pay it. If you die during the session, you benefit from the insurance, if you don't die, well, too bad. Resurrection insurance levels : 0-cred resurrection insurance : Regular backup and minimal infoshell processing in case you die. 1-cred resurrection insurance : Regular backup and 2-aug shell, the MC describes its type and look. 2-cred resurrection insurance : Regular backup and a 4-aug shell, you detail its type and look. 3-cred resurrection insurance : Regular backup and an identical shell with as many aug as you had when died or a tailored 6-aug shell, you detail its type and look. Angel/Daemon An angel is an intelligent device that allows you to access and retrieve information, connect to other devices, communicate with the Grid, run your softwares, ... It's essentially a intelligent multi-purpose computer. It can be a portable device with a screen and buttons or can be an integrated aug that interfaces with your augmented reality. Often, it has an intelligent interface that is a pseudofork of its owner. A daemon is exactly the same thing except it's designed to anonymize its user and encrypt its communications.

Since the invention of cortical stacks, the concept of individuality shifted to differentiate even more the difference between bodies (shells) and minds (ego). There are 3 main types of shells : Bioshells are biological bodies. Bioshells may come through natural reproduction or may be clones fast grown in vats. Almost all bioshells are genetically fixed from congenital disorders and have basic biological augmentations such as a reinforced immunitary system. Synthshells are synthetic bodies made of artificial composites. They are usually artificial looking and have a worst sensory integration than bioshells. As such, they usually cost less and are common in poor populations. Infoshells are virtual \"bodies\" connected to the Grid. Infoshells refers to transhumans instanciated in simulspaces without physical bodies and actuators. While some choose to be infoshells, most of them are forced by economical reasons. Because infoshells are not physical bodies, they're always in Virtual reality an may not roll +Kinesics or +Sensors moves. Additionally, they may not have most of the augs listed below. However they may still upgrade their +Sensors and +Memetics stats. Usually, you wont have to buy shells because your resurrection insurance will take care of that in case you die. However, if you have money to spend, here are the costs of buying a shell. A basic infoshell costs 0-cred . A basic synthshell costs 2-cred , +1-cred if you want to choose its downside (else MC chooses), +1-cred if you want to choose its look (else MC chooses).

Roll the dice pool ! If the best dice is a 6 : Success . If it's a 4 or 5 : Partial . If it's a 1, 2 or 3 : Miss . Refer to the move to see what happens. If the MC announces that the roll is on the edge , a partial or a miss will bring additional complications. Move is a general term describing snippets of rules that players have access to. Some moves may give you straight boons to do certain things, some moves allow you to do things that are otherwise impossible, but the really interesting moves are the ones where you have to roll the dice. Moves have a trigger which is the condition needed for the move to happen. For instance, the Convince move has the following trigger : \" When you argue, fast talk or persuade \". This means that the move triggers whenever a PC engage another character by arguing, fast talking or persuading them. When the trigger is met, then a roll will determine what happens next. Moves requiring a roll all have 3 outcome levels : success, partial and miss. A success means that the PC accomplishes what they intend to do. A partial means that the PC accomplishes what they intend to do, but at a cost. A miss means the PC does not accomplishes what they intend to do and, additionally, something bad occurs. It's important to be aware that a partial, while having a cost, is still a hit and not a failure. This means that as the MC you should not make it feel like a failure. On a partial, the PC did what they intended, the cost is something that adds to the situation. Rolling the dice In Silicon Dust, you roll a pool of 6-sided dice. When you need to roll the dice, you first need to create your dice pool. When a move that requires a roll is triggered, look first for the associated stat . Your base dice pool contains as many dice as the move associated stat. For instance, the move Deploy violence requires to roll +Kinesics. On your shell sheet, look at your Kinesics stat and add as many dice to your pool. Next, look at potential bonus and malus. The first kind of bonus or malus comes from the Boost / Disrupt move triggered by another PC. Basically, if they help you, the give you +1d or if they interfere with you, they give you -1d. In all cases they must tell how they help you and they are entangled in the situation and will suffer the consequences alongside you. Only one boost and one disrupt may be in play for a given move, they cannot stack. Another kind of bonus may come from special gear and assets . For instance, you may have CQC softwares giving you +1d to deploy violence in a close combat situation. Some moves may also give you +1d-forward , meaning the next relevant action is given a bonus of +1 die. Other moves may give +1d-ongoing , meaning you have +1 die while the fictional aspect giving you this bonus is relevant. You may also encounter their negative counterparts -1d-forward and -1d-ongoing which remove one die from your pool. Both forward and ongoing modifiers go out of scope when their fictional counterparts is not relevant anymore. The difference is that forward modifiers can be used only once while ongoing modifiers may be used for several rolls. To keep track of forward and ongoing modifiers it's useful to use tokens with different colors or pieces of paper. Finally, you may ask for a basilisk's bargain . It consists of a consequence that will happen in addition to whatever the move says. The consequence of a basilisk's bargains will happen independently of your outcome level, which means that you will suffer this consequence even on a success. Anyone may offer a basilisk's bargain , including the PC making the move, but it's ultimately the MC's choice to decide which bargain is acceptable and it's the PC's choice to accept or refuse the bargain. If you accept it, you gain +1d, if you refuse it, no bonus die. [TODO: Add play examples] You should now have your dice pool. Roll them ! A roll is a success if the highest die of your pool is a 6 . It's a partial if the highest die is a 4 or 5 . And it's a miss if the highest die is 1, 2 or 3 . If you have 0 dice in your pool, you may still roll ! Simply roll 2 dice but look at the lowest die of the two instead of the highest. Go back to your move under the appropriate outcome level and see what happens. [TODO: Add play examples] Rolling the dice : Select your move and get the associated stat bonus as base dice pool. If you're move is boosted by another PC, gain +1d. If your move is disrupted by another PC, loose -1d. If a gear or asset gives a bonus die, add it to the pool. If you have any relevant forward or ongoing modifiers, add and remove die as established. If you accept a basilisk's bargain , gain +1d and suffer the consequence. Roll your dice pool. If the highest die is a 6, it's a success . If the highest die is a 4 or 5, it's a partial . If the highest die is a 1, 2 or 3, it's a miss . Resolving moves When you have rolled the dice and know the resulting outcome level of your roll, you need to read the move to see what happens. For instance, if you rolled a partial on Infiltrate , then refer to the section under partial in this move : Partial : You go unnoticed but the MC chooses 1 : You attract minor attention. You leave something behind. You take something with you. You have to overcome an obstacle. \"You go unnoticed\" for sure because the move says so, but the MC may choose that \"You have to overcome an obstacle\" ! So he may say something like \"Sure you go unnoticed, but the vents lead you to a high speed fan blocking the way. What do you do ?\". Moves with outcome levels are sometimes very explicit and strict in the outcome (e.g. \"You go unnoticed\") and sometimes they need a bit of interpretation (e.g. \"You have to overcome an obstacle\"). Usually, it's the MC's job to interpret the evocative parts of moves, but anyone can propose ideas based on the fictional situation at hand. [TODO: Add play examples] On the edge Sometimes, before you rolled the dice, the MC may say that your roll is on the edge . Mechanically, it's the same as a normal roll, but with a little caveat. On a partial or miss , the MC may make an additional hard complication against you. What this means is that you make your roll as usual, you resolve the consequences of the resulting outcome level as described in your move, and then, the MC chooses one of its hard complications in addition to what the move says. On the edge rolls are a MC tool to frame your action as especially risky. It doesn't reduce your dice pool, meaning it doesn't change your probabilities of succeeding, but in case of a partial or miss, there will be severe consequences. You've been warned.

The physics of simulspaces may be very realistic or outright weird with non-euclidean physics or anything in between. Simulspace time may go faster than real time but there may be limits to that. All shells allow to create their own personal simulspaces and grid inserts allow people to access simulspaces on the Grid. While you may be blocked doing things in simulspaces, you may always log out as long as you have control of your grid inserts. However, an cortical stack running in an ego loader may not be able to log out allowing for effective accelerated torture.","title":"Virtual reality and simulspaces"},{"location":"Transhumanity/#society","text":"Human societies evolved into transhuman societies. ego technology removed the fear of death and profoundly shifted the spiritual values.

Habitats come in various shapes and functionnalities : - Aerostats are mobile stations supported by floating balloons in the dangerous atmospheres of Venus, Jupiter and Saturn. Aerostats benefits from the natural bodies of their planets. They use atmosphere processors to convert the external atmosphere into usable raw material but they always need mining importations for hard materials. On Venus, aerostats descend towards the planet surface at mining facilities to reload their stocks. - Beehives are habitats drilled in asteroids. They consists of connected clusters of corridors and rooms. Beehives are interface with the void of space through pressurized locks. Most beehives have an external spaceport whethere as a small intellidome or a hard-material building. As they are built in asteroids, they usually are microgravity environments and consequently have confusing 3D architecture for transhumans not used to 0-g designs. Some modern beehives control and are built as arrays of concentric circles to use the asteroid rotation as artificial gravity. Beehives first use the rock and ice of their host asteroid as raw material for fabrication. - Intellidomes are habitats built on terrestrial planets and asteroids. They consist of several layers of programmable nanotech that separates the dome internal atmosphere from the void of space or the planet's atmosphere. These programmable layers allow for shuttles with authorization to enter and exit the dome by opening and closing themselves in order to minimize atmosphere losses while allowing shuttles to come and go. Intellidomes are not always domes, they can be of various reconfigurable shapes but the term comes from early adoptions of this technology. Intellidomes can selectively filter light and radiation in order to protect its population and to recreate day-night cycles. They come in various sizes, from small stations of a few dozen meters to large cities of a few kilometers. - O'Neill cylinders are huge nanocarbon cylinders rotating around their central axis to provide artificial gravity. Habitations are built [...] - Space stations are habitats orbiting around a massive planetary or stellar body. Orbital stations are orbiting around a singular body, usually a planet while Lagrange stations are located at the stable lagrange points of some planet orbits. Solar system Sol Habitats : Habitats in sol's corona are space stations protected by a tear-shaped shell generating a strong electromagnetic field and providing an effective cooling system. Habitats cost a lot because of the difficulty to maintain them. Resources : Energy. Needs : Atmosphere, Water, Metals. Mercury Habitats : Mercury habitats are intellidomes and underground stations mostly located near the poles and inside the curves of asteroid craters to benefit of the best protection against the sun.
